        <!-- Book Summary -->
        <p>
            Solo by Kwame Alexander and Mary Rand Hess is a New York Times bestseller! Kirkus Reviews said Solo is, “A contemporary hero's journey, brilliantly told.” Through the story of a young Black man searching for answers about his life, Solo empowers, engages, and encourages teenagers to move from heartache to healing, burden to blessings, depression to deliverance, and trials to triumphs . Blade never asked for a life of the rich and famous. In fact, he'd give anything not to be the son of Rutherford Morrison, a washed-up rock star and drug addict with delusions of a comeback. Or to no longer be part of a family known most for lost potential, failure, and tragedy, including the loss of his mother. The one true light is his girlfriend, Chapel, but her parents have forbidden their relationship, assuming Blade will become just like his father. In reality, the only thing Blade and Rutherford have in common is the music that lives inside them. And songwriting is all Blade has left after Rutherford, while drunk, crashes his high school graduation speech and effectively rips Chapel away forever. But when a long-held family secret comes to light, the music disappears. In its place is a letter, one that could bring Blade the freedom and love he's been searching for, or leave him feeling even more adrift. Solo : If you enjoy Solo , check out Swing by Kwame Alexander and Mary Rand Hess.

            I first read another book by this author, and it made me sob, this one would have to except that I am not alone. I love the way it is written and the way you can follow the story easily. I loved the characters and the story line. Absolutely life changing.

        <h2>The Archer</h2>
        <!-- Book Author -->
        <h3>Paulo Coelho</h3>
        <!-- Book Cover with Link to Source -->
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52585195-the-archer"><img src="images/The-Archer.png" alt="Cover Page of The Archer by Paulo Coelho"></a>
        <!-- Book Summary -->
        <p>
            In The Archer we meet Tetsuya, a man once famous for his prodigious gift with a bow and arrow but who has since retired from public life, and the boy who comes searching for him. The boy has many questions, and in answering them Tetsuya illustrates the way of the bow and the tenets of a meaningful life. Paulo Coelho's story suggests that living without a connection between action and soul cannot fulfill, that a life constricted by fear of rejection or failure is not a life worth living. Instead, one must take risks, build courage, and embrace the unexpected journey fate has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the wisdom, generosity, simplicity, and grace that have made him an international bestseller, Paulo Coelho provides the framework for a rewarding life: hard work, passion, purpose, thoughtfulness, the willingness to fail, and the urge to make a difference.
